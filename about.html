            <p>
                Hello! I'm a Data Science student pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Data Science with a minor in Business. I'm passionate about using data to solve real-world problems, especially those related to business and finance.
                
                I currently work in the client service department at a financial company, where I apply my communication and problem-solving skills to help clients with their needs. This experience complements my academic background and deepens my understanding of data-driven business strategies.

            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy learning about SQL, Python, and data visualization, and Iâ€™m actively building a portfolio of projects that showcase my skills in these areas.
